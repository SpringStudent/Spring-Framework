This part of the reference documentation covers Spring Framework's support for the
presentation tier (and specifically web-based presentation tiers) including support
for WebSocket-style messaging in web applications.

Spring Framework's own web framework, <<mvc,Spring Web MVC>>, is covered in the
first couple of chapters. Subsequent chapters are concerned with Spring Framework's
integration with other web technologies, such as <<jsf,JSF>>.

Following that is coverage of Spring Framework's MVC <<portlet,portlet framework>>.

The section then concludes with comprehensive coverage of the Spring Framework
<<websocket>> (including <<websocket-stomp>>).
