/**
 * An extension of the {@link Lifecycle} interface for those objects that require to
 * be started upon ApplicationContext refresh and/or shutdown in a particular order.
 * The {@link #isAutoStartup()} return value indicates whether this object should
 * be started at the time of a context refresh. The callback-accepting
 * {@link #stop(Runnable)} method is useful for objects that have an asynchronous
 * shutdown process. Any implementation of this interface <i>must</i> invoke the
 * callback's {@code run()} method upon shutdown completion to avoid unnecessary
 * delays in the overall ApplicationContext shutdown.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends {@link Phased}, and the {@link #getPhase()} method's
 * return value indicates the phase within which this Lifecycle component should
 * be started and stopped. The startup process begins with the <i>lowest</i> phase
 * value and ends with the <i>highest</i> phase value ({@code Integer.MIN_VALUE}
 * is the lowest possible, and {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE} is the highest possible).
 * The shutdown process will apply the reverse order. Any components with the
 * same value will be arbitrarily ordered within the same phase.
 *
 * <p>Example: if component B depends on component A having already started,
 * then component A should have a lower phase value than component B. During
 * the shutdown process, component B would be stopped before component A.
 *
 * <p>Any explicit "depends-on" relationship will take precedence over the phase
 * order such that the dependent bean always starts after its dependency and
 * always stops before its dependency.
 *
 * <p>Any {@code Lifecycle} components within the context that do not also
 * implement {@code SmartLifecycle} will be treated as if they have a phase
 * value of 0. That way a {@code SmartLifecycle} implementation may start
 * before those {@code Lifecycle} components if it has a negative phase value,
 * or it may start after those components if it has a positive phase value.
 *
 * <p>Note that, due to the auto-startup support in {@code SmartLifecycle}, a
 * {@code SmartLifecycle} bean instance will usually get initialized on startup
 * of the application context in any case. As a consequence, the bean definition
 * lazy-init flag has very limited actual effect on {@code SmartLifecycle} beans.
